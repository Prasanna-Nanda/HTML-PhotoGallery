            <h4><br>Madurai: </br></h4>
            <p> <br>Experts who had come down to Madurai recently for a workshop on ‘National Brick Mission: Roadmap for
                </br>
                <br> Kiln Sector’ urged brick manufacturers in Tamil Nadu to shift to induced kiln technology, to</br>
                <br> reduce environmental degradation and reduce fuel wastage in the making of bricks. According to
                them, </br>
                <br> brick production in Tamil Nadu is still being operated in the relatively old bull trench kiln
                technology </br>
                <br> which is not that fuel efficient, contributes to environmental pollution and causes </br>
                <br> considerable emission of greenhouse gases. There is, therefore, a need to start switching </br>
                <br> to induced high draft zig zag kilns to counter all this negative fallout of brick kiln
                operations.</br>

            <h3>Flower gardens</h3>
            <img src="photo_galary/Garden" alt="Garden" style="width:60%">
            <h4> <br>Flower gardens:</br></h4>
                <p>  <br> Though flower gardens in different countries may vary in the types of plants that are grown, </br>
                <br> the basic planning and principles are nearly the same, whether the gardens are formal or
                informal.</br>
                <br> Trees and shrubs are the mainstay of a well-designed flower garden. These permanent features </br>
                <br> are usually planned first, and the spaces for herbaceous plants, annuals, and bulbs are </br>
                <br> arranged around them. The range of flowering trees and shrubs is enormous. It is important, </br>
                <br> however, that such plants be appropriate to the areas they will occupy when mature. Thus it is
                </br>
                <br> of little use to plant a forest tree that will grow 100 feet (30 metres) high and 50 feet across
                </br>
                <br> in a small suburban front garden 30 feet square, but a narrow flowering cherry or redbud </br>
                <br> tree would be quite suitable.</br>

            <h3>Public Park</h3>
            <img src="photo_galary/Park.jpg" alt="Park" style="width:60%">
            <h4><br>Public Park:</br></h4>
                <p> <br> These game preserves evolved into landscaped parks set around mansions and country houses</br>
                <br> from the sixteenth century onward. These may have served as hunting grounds but they also </br>
                <br> proclaimed the owner's wealth and status. An aesthetic of landscape design began in these </br>
                <br> stately home parks where the natural landscape was enhanced by landscape architects such as</br>
                <br> Capability Brown and Humphry Repton. The French formal garden such as designed by André Le Nôtre at
                </br>
                <br> Versailles are an earlier and elaborate example. As cities became crowded, the private hunting
                </br>
                <br> grounds became places for the public.</br>

            <img src="photo_galary/Cloudy.jpg" alt="Climate" style="width:60%">
            <h4><br> Cloudy Weather:</br></h4>
                <p> <br> Clouds play an important role in both warming and cooling our planet. Clouds give us a cooler </br>
                <br> climate on Earth than we would enjoy without clouds. However, as Earth’s climate warms, </br>
                <br> we won’t always be able to count on this cooling effect.</br>

            <img src="photo_galary/TeaEstate.jpg" alt="TeaEstate" style="width:60%">
            <h4><br>Tea Estate:</br></h4>
                <p><br>India is one of the largest tea producers in the world, although over 70 percent of its tea is </br>
                <br> consumed within India itself. A number of renowned teas, such as Assam and Darjeeling, also </br>
                <br> grow exclusively in India. The Indian tea industry has grown to own many global tea brands and
                </br>
                <br> has evolved into one of the most technologically equipped tea industries in the world. Tea
                production, </br>
                <br> certification, exportation, and all other facets of the tea trade in India are controlled by </br>
                <br> the Tea Board of India.</br>

            <h4><br>windy-climate:</br></h4>
                <p><br> Wind is the flow of gases on a large scale. On the surface of the Earth, wind consists of the bulk
                </br>
                <br> movement of air. Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed, the types of
                </br>
                <br> forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed
                </br>
                <br> winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn. Winds have various aspects:
                velocity (wind speed); </br>
                <br> the density of the gas involved; energy content or wind energy. The wind is also a critical means
                </br>
                <br> of transportation for seeds, insects, and birds, which can travel on wind currents for thousands
                </br>
                <br> of miles. In meteorology, winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the
                direction </br>
                <br> from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds
                </br>
                <br> of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various
                </br>
                <br> names associated with their average strength, such as breeze, gale, storm, and hurricane.</br>

            <h4><br>Hill stations in India:</br></h4>
                <p>  <br> A hill station is a town located at a higher elevation than the nearby plain or valley. The term
                was </br>
                <br> used mostly in colonial Asia (particularly in India), but also in Africa (albeit rarely), for towns
                </br>
                <br> founded by European emigrants as refuges from the summer heat, up where temperatures are cooler. In
                </br>
                <br> the Indian context, most hill stations are at an altitude of approximately 1,000 to 2,500 metres
                </br>
                <br> (3,300 to 8,200 ft); very few are outside this range.</br>
